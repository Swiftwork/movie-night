    <rating-component :rating="7"></rating-component>
    <p>During a manned mission to Mars, Astronaut Mark Watney is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew.
      But Watney has survived and finds himself stranded and alone on the hostile planet. With only meager supplies, he must
      draw upon his ingenuity, wit and spirit to subsist and find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. Millions of
      miles away, NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring "the Martian" home, while his crewmates
      concurrently plot a daring, if not impossible, rescue mission. As these stories of incredible bravery unfold, the world
      comes together to root for Watney's safe return.</p>
